This readme contains a getting started guide to Operate First.

If you are interested in bringing your project to the Operate First Environment at the Mass Open Cloud (MOC) you have come to the right place. Below is important information and instructions on how to get started.

### There are 3 parts to Operating First

1. Operate First is a concept of bringing pre-release open source software to a production cloud environment.

2. The Open Infrastructure Labs is the upstream where the cloud operators and project developers work in the open to Operate First.

3. The Mass Open Cloud (MOC) is the production cloud resource where projects are run.

### First off - understand the environment

-There are a few basic things that need to be understood about the Operate First environment at the MOC:

-Operate First is an open source initiative. It’s about operating your project software in the open in a production cloud environment.

-Operating at the MOC never implies that any feature or software will ship. Thus a new feature that is being considered can be tested without any implied commitment.

-Open Infrastructure Labs is an open source upstream aimed at cloud providers and operators and that is where much of the operate first work is being done. 

-While a production cloud, the MOC is taking in pre-release software, and thus stability is not guaranteed, and should not be expected. No backup of user data is made. There is no SLA.

-It’s free, but the cost is commitment. The MOC is not a place to bring a project and then leave. It’s expected that the developers will actively participate with the operators whenever needed and be available to help sort out issues.

-The benefit to project developers is bridging back what’s learned to improve their project. 

-Also, projects need to agree that telemetry can be freely harvested from the cloud. It’s purpose is to help evolve open source cloud operations and it extends to building AI Ops tooling.

### Observing

Projects are expected to work with the ops team in the open in github https://github.com/open-infrastructure-labs
There is also work done to manage the infrastructure that can be found in the Open Infrastructure Labs project https://github.com/open-infrastructure-labs

To see what’s happening right now, chat is done on google chat in a room called “Operate First Ops”. 
You may need a specific invite to it, if so let one of the folks here know (Bill or Lars)  

There is an associated mailing list hosted by the MOC: Operate-first-users https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAAYpDdc8
Open Infrastructure Labs also has a mailing list: Openinfralabs http://lists.opendev.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openinfralabs
You can view a dashboard in the OI Labs github to see an overview of what’s happening https://github.com/orgs/open-infrastructure-labs/projects/2


### Bring your project

To get connected and bring your project to the MOC, first bring it to the “MOC Operate First Project Coordination meeting”, which is held on alternate Wednesday’s 8AM US Eastern time. Contact Bill Burns for an invite (bburns@redhat.com).

There is another bi-weekly meeting that shares the same time slot, called “MOC/ODH sprint planning” and it is primarily focused on planning the activities involving the fundamentals of the cloud environment. It is run by Lars Kellogg-Stedman (lars@redhat.com). Contact him to get on the invite once you are committed to joining.
