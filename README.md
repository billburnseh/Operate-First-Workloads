# operate-first-workloads

Coordination of projects that intend to "Operate First" at the Mass Open Cloud (MOC).

Operating First is about develpers bringing pre-releases of projects to a production
cloud to vet their operation as well as their functionality. Only by operating in
a production cloud and interacting with cloud operators can projects be sure that
their code is ready for widespead deployment and use.

These projects are the operate first workloads.

Where appropriate, projects are encouraged to develop their operations in the 
open here at Open Infrastructure Labs, alongside cloud operators that do the
same, and where open source methods and principles are applied to operations.

Coordination of these projects are documented here. There a live "scrum of scrums"
meeting for representatives of these projects that is held bi-weekly via google meet 
on Wednesdays, 8AM US Eastern time. Contact Bill Burns (bburns@redhat.com) 
for an invite.

Projects are expected to create a repo here with a brief description of the project's
plans to operate first at the MOC and provide links to any relevant project repos or
docs that are elsewhere. There is no need to duplicate everything here, but please
provide enough so that other projects as well as the MOC cloud operations team
can interact and find details when needed.

This project and the meeting serve as input to the MOC to allow for proper planning
and management of the resouce needs of all, as well as connecting projects that
might cooperate and benefit from coolaboration.
